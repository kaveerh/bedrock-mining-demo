# Explain Use Case
Rock stability analysis is a complex task that involves various methods and techniques. Here, I'll provide you with a basic code for a simple rock stability analysis using the python program, which is a  tool for rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering. Please note that this is a simplified example and actual rock stability analysis requires more detailed input data and consideration of various factors.


**Please note that this is a highly simplified example and actual rock stability analysis in mining requires more detailed input data and consideration of various factors, such as joint sets, faults, and other geological features.**

```bash 
Provide me a example of code Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system in python
```





```python 

def calculate_rmr(ucs, rqd, spacing, condition, water, orientation):
    """
    Calculate the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) based on the input parameters.
    
    Parameters:
    ucs (float): Uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock (MPa)
    rqd (int): Rock Quality Designation (%)
    spacing (float): Joint spacing (m)
    condition (int): Joint condition (1-5)
    water (int): Water condition (0-4)
    orientation (int): Orientation of discontinuities (-12 to 0)
    
    Returns:
    float: Rock Mass Rating (RMR)
    """
    
    # Strength of intact rock material
    if ucs >= 250:
        strength_rating = 15
    elif ucs >= 100:
        strength_rating = 12
    elif ucs >= 50:
        strength_rating = 7
    elif ucs >= 25:
        strength_rating = 4
    elif ucs >= 5:
        strength_rating = 2
    elif ucs >= 1:
        strength_rating = 1
    else:
        strength_rating = 0
        
    # RQD rating
    rqd_rating = rqd
    
    # Joint spacing rating
    if spacing > 2:
        spacing_rating = 20
    elif spacing >= 0.6:
        spacing_rating = 15
    elif spacing >= 0.2:
        spacing_rating = 10
    elif spacing >= 0.06:
        spacing_rating = 8
    else:
        spacing_rating = 5
        
    # Joint condition rating
    condition_rating = 30 * (condition - 1) / 4
    
    # Water condition rating
    water_rating = 15 - 7 * water
    
    # Orientation rating
    orientation_rating = orientation
    
    # Calculate RMR
    rmr = strength_rating + rqd_rating + spacing_rating + condition_rating + water_rating + orientation_rating
    
    return rmr

# Example usage
ucs = 80  # MPa
rqd = 70  # %
spacing = 0.3  # m
condition = 3  # 1-5
water = 2  # 0-4
orientation = -5  # -12 to 0

rmr_value = calculate_rmr(ucs, rqd, spacing, condition, water, orientation)
print(f"Rock Mass Rating (RMR): {rmr_value}")

```

In this code, the `calculate_rmr` function takes six parameters: uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock (`ucs`), Rock Quality Designation (`rqd`), joint spacing (`spacing`), joint condition (`condition`), water condition (`water`), and orientation of discontinuities (`orientation`).

The function calculates the ratings for each parameter based on the guidelines provided in the RMR system. It then combines these ratings to calculate the final RMR value, which is returned by the function.

In the example usage section, you can provide the input parameter values, and the code will calculate and print the RMR value.

Note that this code assumes the input parameters are valid and within the expected ranges. In a real-world application, you may want to add input validation and error handling to ensure the code behaves correctly with various inputs.
