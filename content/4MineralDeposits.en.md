# Explain Use Case
Predicting mineral deposit locations involves a combination of geological knowledge, data analysis, and machine learning techniques

For this example, let's assume we have a dataset with the following features:



X: A 2D array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing geological features such as:

elevation: Elevation of the terrain (m)

distance_to_fault: Distance to the nearest fault line (m)

rock_type: Type of rock ( categorical: 0 = sedimentary, 1 = igneous, 2 = metamorphic)

 geochemical_anomaly: Presence of geochemical anomalies (binary: 0 = no, 1 = yes)



y: A 1D array of shape (n_samples,) containing the target variable:

deposit: Presence of a mineral deposit (binary: 0 = no, 1 = yes)
```bash 
can you provide me sample code for Predicting Mineral Deposit Location
```



1. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using `pandas`.
2. The features (`X`) and target variable (`y`, representing the presence or absence of a mineral deposit) are separated.
3. The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
4. A Random Forest Classifier is instantiated using `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble`.
5. The model is trained on the training data using the `fit` method.
6. Predictions are made on the test set using the `predict` method.
7. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics from `sklearn.metrics`, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
8. To predict mineral deposit locations for new data, create a `pandas` DataFrame with the feature values, and use the trained model's `predict` method to make predictions.


```python
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import geopandas as gpd
import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import show
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset (assuming it's a CSV file)
df = pd.read_csv('mineral_deposit_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
# Convert categorical variables to numerical variables using one-hot encoding
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['rock_type', 'geochemical_anomaly'])

# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop(['deposit_location'], axis=1)
y = df['deposit_location']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Random Forest Classifier model
rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
rfc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rfc.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))


```



# Explain Use Case

This code generates synthetic data for the mineral deposit dataset with the following characteristics:

* Elevation: uniformly distributed between 0 and 1000 meters
* Distance to fault: uniformly distributed between 0 and 5000 meters
* Rock type: categorical with three


```bash 
Given me code to generate synthetic data that will be needed for that csv file 
```



1. The number of samples (`n_samples`) and features (`n_features`) are defined.
2. Synthetic feature data is generated using `np.random.rand`, which creates random values between 0 and 1.
3. A function `generate_mineral_deposit_label` is defined to generate mineral deposit labels based on arbitrary rules involving the feature values. In this example, three rules are defined, but you can modify them according to your requirements.
4. The mineral deposit labels are generated by applying the rules to the feature data using `np.logical_or` and `np.logical_and`.
5. A `pandas` DataFrame is created from the feature data and mineral deposit labels.
6. Feature names are added to the DataFrame columns.
7. The DataFrame is saved as a CSV file named `mineral_deposit_data.csv` using the `to_csv` method.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Define the number of samples
n_samples = 1000

# Define the features and their distributions
features = {
    'rock_type': np.random.choice(['igneous', 'sedimentary', 'metamorphic'], n_samples),
    'geochemical_anomaly': np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], n_samples),
    'latitude': np.random.uniform(-90, 90, n_samples),
    'longitude': np.random.uniform(-180, 180, n_samples),
    'elevation': np.random.uniform(0, 5000, n_samples),
    'distance_to_fault': np.random.uniform(0, 100, n_samples),
    'geochemical_value': np.random.normal(0, 1, n_samples),
    'deposit_location': np.random.choice([0, 1], n_samples, p=[0.8, 0.2])  # 80% no deposit, 20% deposit
}

# Create a Pandas DataFrame from the features
df = pd.DataFrame(features)

# Add some noise to the data
df['geochemical_value'] += np.random.normal(0, 0.1, n_samples)

# Save the data to a CSV file
df.to_csv('mineral_deposit_data.csv', index=False)
```
This code generates synthetic data for the following features:

* `rock_type`: categorical variable with three categories (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic)
* `geochemical_anomaly`: categorical variable with two categories (yes, no)
* `latitude` and `longitude`: continuous variables representing geographic coordinates
* `elevation`: continuous variable representing elevation above sea level
* `distance_to_fault`: continuous variable representing distance to a geological fault
* `geochemical_value`: continuous variable representing a geochemical measurement
* `deposit_location`: binary variable indicating whether a mineral deposit is present (1) or not (0)
